\title{Draw a random, strictly increasing age model given a vector 'ages' and
their associated 1 sigma uncertainties ('sigmas') according to a
Gaussian. Requires that the difference between time steps should be
within a ratio firstdiffagreementratio' (default to 1, or 100%).
Always returns a strictly increasing agemodel.}
\usage{
draw_agemodel(ages, sigmas, n.sigma = 2, firstdiffagreementratio = 1,
  tolerance = 10^-12)
}
\arguments{
\item{ages}{A vector containing the age data. Must be strictly increasing.}

\item{sigmas}{A vector containing the 1 sigma uncertainties associated with
the age data.}

\item{n.sigma}{Which sigma level?}

\item{firstdiffagreementratio}{How large can the slope between time steps be?
Defaults to 1, or 100 percent.}

\item{tolerance}{A tolerance level to speed up computations when age points
are very close.}
}
\value{
An randomly drawn age model.
}
