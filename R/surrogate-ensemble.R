#' Generates surrogate series for 'ts', which is a numeric vector.
#'
#'  Implemented methods are:
#'    "random"    (Randomly shuffle data)
#'    "phase"     (Theiler's phase randomization - constrained)
#'    "ebisuzaki" (Another form (identical?) of phase randomisation)
#'    "aaft"      (Theiler's AAFT - constrained)
#'    "ce"        (Davies and Harte's Circulant Embedding - nonconstrained)
#'    "dh"        (Davison and Hinkleys phase and amplitude randomization - nonconstrained)
#'
#'    The null hypotheses for these methods are (information about the
#'    methods of the 'fractal' package is mostly paraphrased or directly
#'     copied from its R-documentation):
#'    "random":    The data represents white noise.
#'    "phase":     The original data can be reproduced by a linear Gaussian process.
#'                 The phase at each frequency of the Fourier transform of the original
#'                 time series is randomised to be uniformly distributed on [0, 2*PI].
#'                 Periodograms of the surrogate and the original time series are the same.
#'    "ebisuzaki":
#'    "aaft:       Create normally distributed white noise, rank-ordered according to the
#'                 original time series. The white noise is then phase randomised, and its
#'                 rank is calculated. The surrogate is then produced by rank ordering the
#'                 original time series according to the new rank. Surrogate preserves the
#'                 amplitude distribution (histogram) of the original time series.
#'    "ce":        Circulant embedding. Generate surrogate whose estimated SDF (periodogram)
#'                 is not constrained to be the same as for the original time series.
#'                 Unconstrained.
#'    "dh":        Davison-Hinkley surrogates. Randomises both the phases and the amplitudes
#'                 in the frequency domain. The surrogate is then produced by inverting back
#'                 to the time domain. Unconstrained.
